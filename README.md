# Prova Finale Reti Logiche 20/21
## Description
This repository contains my submission for the Digital Netoworks (Reti Logiche) project at Politecnico Di Milano. The goal of the project was to design and impement in VHDL, an hardware description language, a component able to perform the histogram equalization algorithm. The histogram equalization algorithm takes as input an image (an array of pixels), and recalibrates the contrast by redistributing the value of the pixels on the density interval.
